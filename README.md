# Register-based-research
RegisterResearch - General discussion and code sharing on register based research 

The organization "registerresearch" is intended for code sharing and sharing of general experience and knowledge pertaining to register based research. The information here is open to everyone who signs up as a member. We encourage all researchers to contribute and participate in this community. We hope that you are willing to share with others and that you will benefit from finding useful program code, solutions and examples.

REGISTERRESEARCH is organized into teams:
1. Software (i.e. SAS, SPSS, etc)
2. Register (i.e. LISA, Cause Of Death register, etc.)
3. Research topic (demography, survival analysis, ect.)

Under the current repository (register-based-research) it is expected that people contribute with general information and program code that is of general interest or otherwise does not fit into any of the other repositories, i.e. under a specific programming language,a specific register, or a specific research topic.

If you are looking for targeted information belonging to one of the teams,please look for or put your code into a repository under one of these teams. 

###If you would like to belong to a team
Please mail your GitHub username (if you are not registered go to http://github.com) to Johan Fihn at johan.fihn@snd.gu.se or Olof Olsson olof.olsson@snd.gu.se or
Elisabeth Strandhagen at elisabeth.strandhagen@snd.gu.se or
Magnus Stenbeck at magnus.stenbeck@ki.se

and we will sign you up.

If you have suggestions for new repositories (new software groups, registers, or research topics), please let us know 
and we will create the repository for you.
