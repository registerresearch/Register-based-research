# Register-based-research
RegisterResearch - General discussion and code sharing on register based research 

The organization "registerresearch" is intended for code sharing and sharing of general experince and knowledge pertaining to 
register based research. The information here is open to everyone who signs up as a member. We encourage all researchers
to controbute with program code and experiences.

Under the current repository it is expected that people contribute with general information and program code that is of
egnerla interest or otherwise does not fit into any of the other repositories, i.e. under a specific programming language,
a specifc register, or a specific research topic.

If you are looking for targeted information belonging to one of the teams in here (software, register, or research topic),
please look for or put your code into a repository under one of these teams. 

This service is provided by the Swedish National Dataservice (SND) at Gothenburg university as part of the SIMSAM INFRA
project aiming att building infarstructure for register based research. If you would like to belong to a team, please mail

Johan Fihn at johan.fihn@snd.gu.se or
Elisabeth Strandhagen at elisabeth.strandhagen@snd.gu.se or
Magnus Stenbeck at magnus.stenbeck@ki.se

and we will sign you up.

If you have suggestions for new repositories (new software groups, registers, or research topics), please let us know 
and we will create the repository for you.

We hope that you are willing to share with other researchers and that you will benefit fron finding solutions and
examples you can use within the framwork of REGISTERRESEARCH.

Johan, Elisabeth and Magnus
